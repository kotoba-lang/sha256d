  "Meet-in-the-middle / splice-and-cut preimage ATTACK-PARAMETER search for reduced-round
  SHA-256 -- the real, published family of BELOW-BRUTE-FORCE preimage algorithms
  (Aoki & Sasaki 2009; extended by the biclique technique, Khovratovich-Rechberger-
  Savelieva 2012). Run via the co-scientist shape: Generation enumerates cut/arc configs,
  Reflection is a HARD gate verifying neutrality against the message-schedule dependency
  graph, Ranking orders by attack complexity, Meta-review reports the best below-brute-force
  attack per round count.

  IMPORTANT / HONEST SCOPE. This does NOT break full 64-round SHA-256 and cannot: it searches
  the attack-configuration space and *computes the resulting complexity* (cryptanalysis papers
  report complexity; they do not run a 2^128 attack either). On reduced rounds it yields
  genuine below-2^256 preimage attacks. As rounds grow, the message expansion's dependency
  fan-out collapses the neutral sets so the savings go to zero -- which is exactly WHY full
  SHA-256 has no known meaningful-margin preimage attack. The search demonstrates the wall
  rather than crossing it.

  The core object is the message-schedule dependency graph: which of the 16 free base words
  W0..W15 each expanded word W_t (t>=16) transitively depends on, via
  W_t = sigma1(W_{t-2}) + W_{t-7} + sigma0(W_{t-15}) + W_{t-16}."

;; (A) Pushing past word granularity: bit-level neutral bits + bicliques + evolutionary search.
;; The honest finding, backed by the demonstrator below: under SOUND analysis, a bit-level
;; search gives NO gain over the word-level one -- a single bit of base word W_i is neutral for
;; a chunk iff the *whole* word W_i is unused by that chunk (used-base-words). Diffusion +
;; message expansion mean any bit of a used word perturbs the chunk. So the co-scientist
;; tournament over neutral SETS bottoms out at word granularity (~24 rounds); the config space
;; is small enough that the exhaustive `best-attack` already returns the optimum, so the
;; evolutionary/Elo machinery is not yet *needed* here.
;;
;; The real gap to the published ~45-round / 2^255.5 record is BICLIQUES (initial structures
;; that manufacture extra rounds of independence via differential trails) + probabilistic
;; partial matching. Those relax soundness in controlled, differential-verified ways -- they are
;; not a neutral-set search, and this repo does not fabricate their complexity. That larger,
;; genuinely-intractable space (which biclique dimensions, which trails) is where a true
;; evolutionary / MILP / SAT search becomes necessary rather than optional.
